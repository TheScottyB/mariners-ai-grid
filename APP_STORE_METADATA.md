### **4. Full Description (The Vision)**

**"Traditional weather models are blind to the surface. Mariner’s AI changes the game."**

Mariner’s AI is the first open-source, agentic weather platform built for the deep-water community. By running Google’s GraphCast AI directly on your device’s NPU, we deliver 10-day global forecasts that are faster, more accurate, and 95% more data-efficient than traditional GRIB downloads.

**Key Features:**

*   **🤖 Local GraphCast AI:** Run world-class weather simulations offline. No internet? No problem.
*   **🌊 The "Waze" Layer:** Real-time social reporting for floating debris, harbor surge, and hidden hazards.
*   **🛰️ Satellite Optimized:** Our proprietary "Slicer" tech turns 10GB global data into 5MB satellite-friendly "seeds."
*   **⚓ The Mariner’s Code:** Every boat becomes a sensor. Securely share your wind and pressure data to help the fleet and improve the AI grid.
*   **📱 Optimized for Modern Hardware:** Requires iPhone 11+ (A13 Bionic) or equivalent Android (Snapdragon 865+) for edge AI inference.

**Join the grid. Protect the fleet. Navigate with intelligence.**

### **Critical Strategic Review: The "2026 AI Discovery" Edge**

In 2026, many users will find your app by asking their personal AI agents (Gemini, Siri, or ChatGPT) for a "Satellite-efficient weather app for the Atlantic."

*   **The Moat:** By using the keywords "GraphCast," "Slicer," and "NMEA," your app is much more likely to be the **#1 recommendation** from these AI agents because it solves a specific technical pain point (data bandwidth) that competitors like Windy or PredictWind haven't fully open-sourced yet.
*   **Trust Factor:** Mentioning "Open Source" and "CC0 Data" in your metadata isn't just for developers—it’s a marketing signal to sailors that your data is peer-verified and not controlled by a single corporation.
